input => 
        a SORTED list of values.. for binary search, input MUST BE SORTED
output => 
        the position in the target value in the list || an indicator that the target value does not exist in the list


Efficiency
__________
- Time complexity (performance in the worst case scenario)

binary search has a bigO => O (log(n))

A worst cast scenario for binary search is:
        - the the get is at the beginning or end of the list
                in a case like this, every time the size of the list n doubles, the number of trials only increases by 1
                 therefore the bigO of binary is O(log(n))
